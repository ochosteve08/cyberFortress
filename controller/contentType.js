// To ensure that the content type passes high security standards in your Node.js, 
// Express, and MongoDB API, you can follow these practices:

// Content-Type Validation: Implement validation of the Content-Type header in incoming requests 
// to ensure that it matches the expected format and is one of the supported content types for your API. 
// Reject requests with unsupported or unexpected Content-Type values to prevent potential security risks.

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const contentType = req.get("Content-Type");
  if (!isValidContentType(contentType)) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid Content-Type" });
  }
  next();
});

function isValidContentType(contentType) {
  // Implement your validation logic here
  // Check if the contentType is one of the expected values
  // Return true if valid, false otherwise
}

// Content-Type Header Whitelisting: Limit the allowed Content-Type values to a specific set of expected values. By whitelisting the Content-Type headers, you prevent potential abuse of unexpected or malicious content types.

// Content-Type Header Sanitization: Sanitize and normalize the Content-Type header value before processing it. Remove any leading or trailing white spaces, convert to lowercase, and ensure consistency for comparison and validation purposes.

// Strict Parsing of Request Bodies: Implement strict parsing and validation of request bodies based on the Content-Type header. Use appropriate middleware or libraries to parse and validate incoming request bodies, ensuring that they match the expected format and content type.

// Request Body Validation: Validate the request body against the expected schema or structure based on the Content-Type header. Use libraries or built-in validation mechanisms to enforce the structure, data types, and constraints of the request body payload.

// Secure Deserialization: If your API accepts serialized data in the request body (e.g., JSON, XML), ensure secure deserialization. Use secure deserialization libraries or practices to prevent potential deserialization vulnerabilities such as remote code execution or object injection.

// Content-Type Response Headers: Set appropriate Content-Type headers in your API responses to inform clients about the type of content being returned. Ensure consistency between the actual response content and the Content-Type header to prevent confusion and potential security risks.

// By implementing these practices, you can ensure that the content type passes high security standards in your Node.js, Express, and MongoDB API. Regularly review and update your validation logic and security measures as new content types and vulnerabilities emerge.
