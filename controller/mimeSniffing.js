// In an Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB API project, integrating MIME
// sniffing involves setting the appropriate response headers to instruct the browser
//  not to perform MIME sniffing. Here's an example of how you can implement this in your project:

const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Middleware to prevent MIME sniffing
const preventMimeSniffing = (req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff");
  next();
};

// Apply the middleware globally to all routes
app.use(preventMimeSniffing);

// Define your routes and API endpoints
// ...

// Start the server
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});


// In the code above, we define a middleware function called preventMimeSniffing.
// This middleware sets the X-Content-Type-Options header with the value 'nosniff',
// instructing the browser not to perform MIME sniffing.

// We then use app.use() to apply the preventMimeSniffing middleware globally,
// which ensures that the header is included in every response sent by your Express application.

// By setting the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff', you prevent the browser from interpreting 
//the response content based on MIME sniffing, and it will strictly adhere to the declared content type provided by the server. 
//This helps mitigate security risks associated with MIME sniffing attacks.

// It's important to note that setting the X-Content-Type-Options header alone is not sufficient to secure your application from 
//all potential vulnerabilities. It should be used in conjunction with other security practices, such as proper input validation, output encoding, and following security best practices to ensure a robust and secure API.

//By implementing this middleware in your Express.js project, you can integrate MIME sniffing prevention and enhance the security of your API.
